ðŸŒŽ This is everything that makes my personal website and blog tick.  Feel free to check it out! (and Star it, perhaps?)

_Note_: This version of the website is **not currently online**. Right now, the domain points to a temporary page which will soon be removed (once I've finished working on this site).

## Installation
If you'd like to run this website locally:
- `git clone https://github.com/abdullah-K/khanabdullah.com` to somewhere on your local machine.
- run `npm install` and let it do its thing.
- run `gulp`.
- run `node index.js` and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- marvel at the sight you behold.

## Contribute
I will happily accept contributions to this site from you through Pull Requests :grin:.
If you see any bugs/weird things, please open an Issue on this repository!
